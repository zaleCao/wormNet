After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975).

After animals are removed from bacterial food, they initiate a local search behavior consisting of reversals and deep omega-shaped turns. This is followed by dispersal ~30 min later as reversal and turns are suppressed. Local search behavior is triggered by AWC olfactory neurons, ASK gustatory neurons, and AIB interneurons while dispersal is promoted by ASI gustatory neurons and AIY interneurons (Gray et al., 2005). - Thermosensor: After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975).

After animals are removed from bacterial food, they initiate a local search behavior consisting of reversals and deep omega-shaped turns. This is followed by dispersal ~30 min later as reversal and turns are suppressed. Local search behavior is triggered by AWC olfactory neurons, ASK gustatory neurons, and AIB interneurons while dispersal is promoted by ASI gustatory neurons and AIY interneurons (Gray et al., 2005).The AWC neurons synapse onto several interneurons including AIB and AIY, which enhance and suppress turning, respectively. The AWC neurons activate the AIB interneurons through AMPA-type glutamate receptors and inhibit AIY interneurons through glutamate-gated chloride channels. AWC are odor-OFF neurons that are activated by odor removal and inhibited in the continued presence of odors. On prolonged exposure to odorant (over 30 min), adaptation to AWC-sensed odors occurs, abrogating the chemotactic response. NLP-1 is required for these AWC-dependent food-evoked behaviors and odor adaptation (Chalasani et al., 2010; Chalasani et al., 2007; Gray et al., 2005; L'Etoile and Bargmann, 2000; Bargmann et al., 1993). - Thermosensor: After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Animals sense and record their Tc by AFD (major thermosensory) and AWC and ASI neurons (Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al., 2008; Biron et al., 2008). This Tc memory is plastic and can be reset upon cultivation at a different temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Activity of both the AFD and the AWC neurons is essential for the execution of thermotactic behaviors with high fidelity and precision. Upon sensation of a higher temperature than Tc, Ca++ concetration in AWC increases via production of cGMP by ODR-1 and activation of cGMP-dependent TAX-4 cation channel (Kuhara et al., 2008). Unlike AFD neurons, which respond to thermal stimuli above Tc with continuous, graded calcium signals in a deterministic and highly reproducible way, AWC neurons exhibit stochastic temperature-evoked Ca++ changes that are stimulus-correlated with different temporal kinetics at temperatures above and below Tc (Biron et al., 2008). AWC appears to get more active as temperatures rise or fall  further from Tc. The AFD, AWC and ASI neurons seem to act in concert to increase turning rate when animals encounter higher temperatures than Tc on a gradient to move down the gradient toward colder temperatures near Tc (negative thermotaxis) (Biron et al., 2008). To track isotherms, animals do not actively pursue isothermal alignment, but once serendipitously aligned along an isotherm (at T=Tc), they track by suppressing turns (Luo et al., 2006). AWC neurons are relatively quiet around temperatures close to the Tc.- One of the three core sensory neurons (AWA, AWC, ASK) that are required for sexual-attraction in males (White and Jorgensen, 2012)."

I5,Pharyngeal interneuron,Pharynx posterior bulb ,"Pharyngeal interneuron. I5 has a very large cell body which is located on the ventral side of the terminal bulb. Two short branches come out of the cell body and split into anterior and posterior projections. At the level of the terminal bulb commissure, the anterior processes end on the cell bodies of M2 motor neurons and are linked to them by desmosomes. Posteriorly, the processes run between pm6 and pm7 and reach a subdorsal position adjacent to the subdorsal marginal cells. Each branch then travels anteriorly to the terminal bulb commissure where they fuse across the dorsal side. Ventrally, these also become attached to the cell bodies of M2 motor neurons by desmosomes. At the level of the subventral nerve cords each branch turns anteriorly and travels to the nerve ring. They make a single closed loop within the nerve ring. A short anterior projection is also seen in the dorsal side of the nerve cord (Albertson and Thomson, 1976).","Serotonin, based on serotonin immunoreactivity (Sawin et al., 2000).

Pharyngeal relaxation becomes quicker when I5 is ablated. When both I5 and M3 are ablated there is a delay in relaxation that is indistinguishable from that caused by ablation of M3 alone, suggesting I5 slows down relaxation by inhibiting M3 (Avery and Thomas, 1997)"

NSML,Motor neuron,Pharynx anterior bulb,"NSM cell bodies are located in the pharyngeal subventral nerve cords just anterior to the nerve ring. These cells are bipolar with one major process from each cell bifurcating near the cell body to two thick processes. There is also a third, long, thin process that originates from the cell body and possibly functions as proprioceptive (Axang et al., 2008). One of the two main branches crosses to the opposite side, turns dorsally within the nerve ring and continues its trajectory posteriorly within the dorsal nerve cord of the isthmus. The other branch runs posteriorly within the subventral nerve cord of the isthmus. These processes run at the most outside edge of the nerve cords, very close to pseudocoelom, and make synapses to the pharyngeal basement membrane and muscle cells. Both processes terminate before reaching the terminal bulb. Within the isthmus these processes periodically swell to form varicosities filled with large, lightly- and darkly-staining membrane bound vesicles, as well as small clear vesicles. Along with these major processes NSM's also have small, synapse-free processes with free endings just under the cuticle of the pharyngeal lumen at the boundary between the corpus and isthmus (where bacteria accumulate). These endings are attached to the adjacent muscle cells by desmosomes and are thought to act as stretch (proprioceptive) receptors.

They were postulated to sense bacteria in their lumen by their proprioceptive endings and transmit this to the rest of the body by secretions to the pseudocoelomic fluid. The presence of food leads to increased pharyngeal pumping, decreased locomotion and increased egg-laying behavior. Exogenous application of serotonin also induces these responses supporting the hypothesis NSM's can function neurohumorally by serotonin secretion. However, ablation of NSM's have only subtle effects on pumping suggesting they may not play any important role in this behavior (Avery et al., 1993, Avery and Thomas, 1997). When placed on a bacterial lawn, previously food-deprived animals slow down their locomotion to a higher degree compared to well-fed animals.

NSMR,Motor neuron,Pharynx anterior bulb,"NSM cell bodies are located in the pharyngeal subventral nerve cords just anterior to the nerve ring. These cells are bipolar with one major process from each cell bifurcating near the cell body to two thick processes. There is also a third, long, thin process that originates from the cell body and possibly functions as proprioceptive (Axang et al., 2008). One of the two main branches crosses to the opposite side, turns dorsally within the nerve ring and continues its trajectory posteriorly within the dorsal nerve cord of the isthmus. The other branch runs posteriorly within the subventral nerve cord of the isthmus. These processes run at the most outside edge of the nerve cords, very close to pseudocoelom, and make synapses to the pharyngeal basement membrane and muscle cells. Both processes terminate before reaching the terminal bulb. Within the isthmus these processes periodically swell to form varicosities filled with large, lightly- and darkly-staining membrane bound vesicles, as well as small clear vesicles. Along with these major processes NSM's also have small, synapse-free processes with free endings just under the cuticle of the pharyngeal lumen at the boundary between the corpus and isthmus (where bacteria accumulate). These endings are attached to the adjacent muscle cells by desmosomes and are thought to act as stretch (proprioceptive) receptors. These processes can not be seen at the light microscopic level (therefore not obvious in GFP images below). They have also been omitted from the drawn images below.

When PVT is ablated embryonically, these axons follow multiple routes to enter the ventral cord instead of making tight bundles (Antebi et al., 1997; Ren et al., 1999). Postembryonically, PVT functions to keep the ventral cord fascicles intact. Early larval ablation of PVT induces axons of AVKL/R, PVQL/R, HSNL/R and RMEV to aberrantly cross the ventral midline (Aurelio et al., 2002)."

Animals navigate the O2 gradients by O2-induced changes in locomotion speed, reversal and turning behavior  (Cheung et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2004). This preference for intermediate O2 levels (Gray et al., 2004), may work to allow oxidative metabolism but avoid oxidative stress (Lee and Atkinson, 1977). The intermediate O2 preference also promotes aggregation behavior, possibly since aggregating C. elegans locally deplete O2 to preferred levels (Gray et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2006). The rise in O2 levels detected by animals leaving a group induces reversal (backing) and turning. Conversely, the fall in O2 encountered when entering a group suppresses reversal, turning, and rapid locomotion, allowing the animal to stay with the group. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC, e.g. GCY-35 and GCY-36)-expressing oxygen-sensing neurons (URX, AQR, PQR, SDQ, BDU, ALN, and PLN) mediate the avoidance of high O2 levels (Zimmer et al, 2009). URX appears to be the most important member of this group, since its activity is uniquely important for aggregation (Coates and de Bono, 2002), while for aerotactic behavior in an O2 gradient, URX is redundant with other sGC-expressing neurons (Chang et al., 2006). The locations of URX in the head and PQR in the tail facilitate high O2 avoidance by the animal accelerating forward without changing direction of movement when its tail/PQR encounters high O2 and by reversal and turning when its head/URX encounters high O2 (Busch et al., 2012). Two post-synaptic targets of URX, AUA and RMG, seem to be involved in this O2-induced behavioral response. The strength of the O2 response is regulated by food, genotype, and an animal’s prior O2 exposure. The lab standard wild-type C. elegans strain (N2) with high activity (due to a gain-of-function mutation) of the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 (215V) is indifferent to high O2 when food is present, whereas C. elegans isolates with low activity of NPR-1 (215F) avoid high O2 in the presence of food, and therefore, aggregate (Gray et al., 2004; Cheung et al., 2005; Rogers et al., 2006). Since all strains avoid high O2 when food is absent, NPR-1 may be an internal food sensor important for food-related regulation of aggregation (i.e., regulation of social behavior on food) (Chang et al., 2006). Cultivation conditions also regulate O2 preference: animals cultivated in hypoxia migrate to lower O2 levels, and avoid high O2 regardless of food or NPR-1 genotype (Cheung et al., 2005; Chang and Bargmann, 2008). The sensory neurons ASH, ADL, and ADF also promote avoidance of high O2 levels (through function of TRP-related channel subunits OCR-2 and OSM-9 and the transmembrane protein ODR-4 in nociceptive ASH and ADL, and serotonin production by ADF), but these cells are not needed after animals are cultivated in hypoxia (Chang et al., 2006; Chang and Bargmann; 2008; Rogers et al., 2006)."

VC1-3 and VC6 send less branched processes to vulval regions but have longer processes in the ventral cord (in R side fascicle). The dorsal branches of VC axons innervate vm2 vulval muscles. These neurons, except VC4 and VC5, also innervate ventral body muscles. The generation of VC neurons from the 6 Pn.a neuroblast lineages (P3.a-P8.a) is dependent on a HOM-C gene, lin-39. In the absence of lin-39, these neurons undergo programmed cell death (Ruvkun, 1997).

VC2,Motor neuron,Body (ventral nerve cord),"Hermaphrodite specific ventral cord motor neurons. The neurons are born in L1, and begin to send out processes in late L3. These processes branch in the region of the vulva during L4. VC4 and VC5 have short ventral cord processes, but send branched processes dorsally along the vulval hypodermis on each side of the vulval slit. VC1-3 and VC6 send less branched processes to vulval regions but have longer processes in the ventral cord (in R side fascicle). The dorsal branches of VC axons innervate vm2 vulval muscles. These neurons, except VC4 and VC5, also innervate ventral body muscles. The generation of VC neurons from the 6 Pn.a neuroblast lineages (P3.a-P8.a) is dependent on a HOM-C gene, lin-39.
